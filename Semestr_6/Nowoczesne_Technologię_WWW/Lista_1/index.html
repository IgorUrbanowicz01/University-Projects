            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Igor Urbanowicz, a student currently on my third year at Wrocław University of Technology (PWR). My coursework has given me a strong foundation in algorithms,
                data structures, and programming, and I'm excited to apply what I've learned to solve complex problems. <br> Some of my favorite topics in the field of computer Sience are 
                funcional programing and graph theory.
                Recently, I've been exploring the world of big data and heuristic algorithms, looking for ways to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges like TSP.
                I'm excited to collaborate with others and contribute to projects.
            </p>
            <p> 
                In my free time, you'll find me running. Now days I'm training for the night half marathon in Wrocław.
                I'm also an avid reader, although finding time for it can be a challenge with my busy schedule.

            </p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Most of my projects have been written in C++ at first, and later in C, so I know it quite well.  <br>
                I have also used Python extensively, which was made easy by all the libraries being written in C. <br>
                Haskell is one of my favorite languages to program in.  <br> 
                Additionally, I have experience in website design using HTML/CSS (as you can see). <br>
                My university coursework has also exposed me to other languages like Julia and Java, although I only have a basic understanding of them. <br>
                I have recently started learning Kotlin, and I find it interesting due to its similarities to Haskell (e.g., lambda notation), so I plan to invest more time in it.</p>

            <p>One of the largest project I,ve writen is a program that compiles an imperative language into virtual machine code simular to a RAM machine.
            More detailed language and machine specifications are included in the <a href="./pdf/compiler.pdf">here</a> (In Polish) file with some example code. The compiler is written in C++ and uses Flex and Bison. <br>
            I wrote it with the help of <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/compilerbook/">Introduction to Compilers and Language Design</a>. Additionally i added some bash scripts that checks if the output for the test files is correct.</p>
            <p>On the right you can see a sinpit of my code in Bison wich usues context free grammar to bulid a AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) upon which we can disect our
                initial code. My compiler has the ability disern varibles between difrent scopes, tell when a varible is uninitialized and point
                to a line that has a syntax mistake.

            <h3>Meta Heuristic Algorithms</h3>
    <article id="project_2">
        <p>Metaheuristic algorithms are a type of optimization algorithm that is used to find near-optimal solutions to complex problems.
             Unlike traditional optimization algorithms, metaheuristic algorithms do not require an exact mathematical model of the problem being solved, and are capable of handling a wide range of problem types and structures.</p>
        <p>The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in computer science. It involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each of a given set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city.
            In order to solve the TSP I've implemented several metaheuristic algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search, Random k, and Opt-2.
            Genetic Algorithm is an optimization algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection, which uses a combination of selection, crossover, and mutation to generate new candidate solutions.
            Tabu Search is a local search-based algorithm that avoids revisiting recently visited solutions.
            Random k is a simple random algorithm that selects k random solutions and returns the best one.
            Opt-2 is a heuristic algorithm that attempts to improve an existing solution by swapping two edges.
            For all of the alorythms metioned above I used Python and the TSP librarie wich helps working with instances of the problem as they can be 
            presented in a vaiarity of difrent ways. </p>
            <p>You can find my and my friends basic paper on the genetic algorithm <a href="./pdf/Sprawozdanie_etap3.pdf">here</a></p>
