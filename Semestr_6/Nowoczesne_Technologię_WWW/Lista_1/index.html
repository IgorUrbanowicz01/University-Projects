            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Igor Urbanowicz, a student currently on my third year at Wrocław University of Technology (PWR). My coursework has given me a strong foundation in algorithms,
                data structures, and programming, and I'm excited to apply what I've learned to solve complex problems. <br> Some of my favorite topics in the field of computer Sience are 
                funcional programing and graph theory.
                Recently, I've been exploring the world of big data and heuristic algorithms, looking for ways to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges like TSP.
                I'm excited to collaborate with others and contribute to projects.
            </p>
            <p> 
                In my free time, you'll find me running. Now days I'm training for the night half marathon in Wrocław.
                I'm also an avid reader, although finding time for it can be a challenge with my busy schedule.

            </p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Most of my projects have been written in C++ at first, and later in C, so I know it quite well.  <br>
                I have also used Python extensively, which was made easy by all the libraries being written in C. <br>
                Haskell is one of my favorite languages to program in.  <br> 
                Additionally, I have experience in website design using HTML/CSS (as you can see). <br>
                My university coursework has also exposed me to other languages like Julia and Java, although I only have a basic understanding of them. <br>
                I have recently started learning Kotlin, and I find it interesting due to its similarities to Haskell (e.g., lambda notation), so I plan to invest more time in it.</p>
